            <h1>Symbat Zharkynkyzy</h1>
            <p>-I came to the USA to continue my postgraduate studies. I studied digital marketing in my master's program. I've lived in Chicago for 3 years now. The idea to open a Kazakh cafe with national flavor in this city came 1 year ago. When I visited Kazakhstan, my nutritionist gave me a list of food places I needed to visit. Among them was the ethno-coffee shop “Tary”. Since then I started thinking about a new profession. Later we heard that it was possible to buy the Tary franchise, and we immediately got down to business. To be honest, I have never worked in this area before. But I became convinced that starting a business is not so difficult if you have investment</p>

            <h1>Ratbek Sadvakasov</h1>
        <p><span>L</span> ast weekend, chef Ratbek Sadvakasov was competing in the Top Chef Challenge at the Vegan Women Summit in Hollywood. He served vivid and carefully composed plates of Impossible Beef meatballs with golden millet, spinach, pumpkin cream, and honey, garnished with steamed broccoli and dried raspberry powder.

            Sadvakasov is not a vegan. Nor is his restaurant, Tary Coffee House. And neither is the owner of the franchise, Symbat Zharkynkyzy, who opened the first U.S. outpost of this central Asian chain in River North last October.
            
            There isn’t much of a vegan tradition in Kazakhstan, where Sadvakasov and Zharkynkyzy grew up. Its cuisine developed around the nomadic, livestock-dependent lifestyle of its people, and the necessity of preserving the meat and milk of the fat-tailed sheep, camels, horses, and cows they raised. “No,” laughs Zharkynkyzy. “We love meat. But I was interested in trying something new. My chef is very talented, and we were thinking, why not? We will be going there and showing our culture and hospitality, and so we just applied.”</p>

        <h1>Our Missions</h1>
        <p>We use only organically sourced products, with 25-30% imported from Kazakhstan, including various types of tea, tary (millet), nabat (traditional candy sugar), kurt (dry fermented milk product), and others
        Sadvakasov also uses quite a bit of butter, milk, housemade cheese, and other fermented dairy products. But the central ingredient at Tary is its namesake—tary—a variety of millet grown only in western Kazakhstan.
        “That product is very important,” she says. “It saved our nation several times in war. People were surviving by eating this product. They had nothing. It’s very rich in nutrients.”</p>

            <h1>Opening day our Tary Ethno Cafe</h1>
            <p>Tary first opened in Kazakhstan in 2020, and Zharkynkyzy said it went “viral” and gained popularity quickly. Now, there are 10 locations in Kazakhstan.

                Zharkynkyzy also moved to Chicago from Kazakhstan in 2020. After getting a master’s degree in digital marketing from the University of Illinois at Chicago, she said she was looking for a project to start in 2022. She also found that Kazakh culture was not as widespread in Chicago and had heard about Tary back home once the brand gained some traction, so she thought opening a Tary coffee shop in the city would be a “perfect fit.”
                
                When she started to look for the perfect location for the shop, Zharkynkyzy said she knew she wanted it to be somewhere downtown to get more traffic and “people from all around the world.”
                
                The coffee shop at 111 W. Illinois St. had a soft opening on Oct. 24 and Zharkynkyzy said business has been “going very, very well” since.</p>
